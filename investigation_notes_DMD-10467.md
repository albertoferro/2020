# Investigation Notes for DMD-10467

**Issue:** Expired signature error encountered in `service.participant/otp_token/decode`.

**Error Message:** `Signature has expired`

**Repository Investigated:** `albertoferro/2020`

**Investigation Steps:**

1.  Reviewed the Jira ticket details and the raw error message.
2.  Used the `search_code` tool to look for relevant code related to "otp_token decode signature", "otp token", "decode token", and "service.participant" within this repository (`albertoferro/2020`).
3.  **Findings:** No relevant code or mentions of OTP token handling, decoding, or signature validation were found within this repository using the available search tools.

**Conclusion:** Based on the investigation within the `albertoferro/2020` repository, the code responsible for handling OTP token decoding and signature validation for the `service.participant` likely resides in a different service or repository not accessible or searchable with the current tools or within the defined scope. The fix for the expired signature error will need to be implemented in the codebase where this logic is located.
